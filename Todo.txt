* write Sprite Sheet Demo Game
* create AnimatedSprite class (with animation logic)
* Add draw loop on top of update loop?  This will result in cleaner code and smoother drawing...  I vote, yes!
* clean up the API
* add comments
* Move test games to seperate package?
	* then maybe add proper tests?
* Potential resource manager?
* Show how to load resources from a SWF? FLA library
